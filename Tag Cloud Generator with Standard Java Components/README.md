Convert your solution to the previous project to generate tag clouds using only components from the standard Java libraries. Here are some specific requirements for this project:

The program should satisfy the functional requirements of the previous project.
You must use the FileReader/BufferedReader and FileWriter/BufferedWriter/PrintWriter components for all the file input and output needed.
You must use the Java Collections Framework components for all the data storing and sorting needed.
You must catch and handle appropriately (e.g., by outputing meaningful error messages) all the IOExceptions that may be thrown by the file I/O code.
These are the stated requirements for your program. If you have questions or need additional details, ask in class.
