You have already written several methods involving the NaturalNumber component family. It's now time to develop a complete application that uses the NaturalNumber components: a natural number calculator. It should work pretty much like any other calculatorâ€”except that it does exact arithmetic with natural numbers that have no explicit bounds on their values, which is unlike any other calculator you have likely seen before.

Do not worry about these two potential complications that a professional version of this application might need to address: computing roots of very large natural numbers, say more than 20 digits, tends to be rather slow; and if the numbers get large enough, say hundreds of digits, then some operations can result in "stack overflow" because some recursion gets too deep for the default maximum size of the run-time stack of the JVM. Other than these issues, the calculator should be "bullet-proof" in the sense that a user cannot do anything to make your program crash.
