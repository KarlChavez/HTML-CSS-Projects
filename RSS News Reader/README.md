RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML application for distributing web content that changes frequently. Many news-related sites, weblogs and other online publishers syndicate their content as an RSS Feed to whoever wants it.

For this project your task is to write a program that asks the user for the URL of an RSS 2.0 feed and for the name of an output file including the .html extension, reads the RSS feed into an XMLTree object and then uses the information in the XMLTree object to generate in the output file a nicely formatted HTML page with table of links to all the news items in the original feed.
