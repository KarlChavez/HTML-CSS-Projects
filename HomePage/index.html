<h1>A Runner's Journey</h1>
<p>As a kid, running was nothing but a burden to me. It was simply a hassle to get from
one location onto another. However, I've come to realize that running was not only
just a constant motion, but it is a form of art. What sets running different from
other sports is the aspect of freedom; the only limit is your imagination and commitment. 
You can run literally anywhere you desire and I think that's the true beauty of running.
There are no limitations to your exploration. My goal in life is to take a step in
every place of the earth. While it may seem a significant, beyond belief of an objective, this
is my runner's journey.</p>
